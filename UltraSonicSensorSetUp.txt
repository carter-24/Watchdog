
Connecting Two Ultra-Sonic Sensors

	Ultra-Sonic Sensor 1:
		Pin 2 for 5V Vcc
		Pin 6 for GND
		Pin 16 for Trig
		Pin 18 for Echo
			Use 1k ohm and 2k ohm (two 1k ohm in series)
		
	Ultra-Sonic Sensor 2:
		Pin 4 for 5V Vcc
		Pin 34 for GND
		Pin 38 for Trig
		Pin 40 for Echo
			Use 1k ohm and 2k ohm (two 1k ohm in series)
